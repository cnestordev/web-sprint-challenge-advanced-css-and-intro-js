How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?
To make a website accessible means that it should be available for anyone, including those with disabilities.
That means writing code in a way that people who use special devices will be able to see and understand the content in a page,
such as creating captions for images or titles for secitons on your webpage.


Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible.
Adding semantic html to your document.  This way people with screen readers will be able to read what part of the page
they're on, and what it's meant to convey.

Adding alt tags to images that will tell someone who is blind what the image is about.

Differentiating between links and buttons so that blind people will know if what they'r on is a link that will take them to a new page
or a button that will activate a particular action on the webpage.

How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?
A variable is a keyword that store information such as words or numbers that you can call later on with the name of the keyword.

What is the purpose of using functions in code?
Functions are meant to group related code together so that it won't run until you call it.  Also, functions allow you to reuse
the same block of code multiple times.
